	<h2>A Letter For The Love Of My Life...</h2>
	<h4>(...and actually my everything)</h4>
	<p class="drop-cap">In this world, I am blessed with the most beautiful and precious girl to ever exist...my beloved Penny<br>

		I am incredibly proud and deeply honored to call you my wife, loving you endlessly and for all eternity with every part of my being.<br>

		<i>“Penny!”</i> it's more than just a name. Every time I say it, my heart overflows with love and gratitude for the joy of hearing your voice and seeing your beautiful smile every single day.<br>

		As we celebrate our year and a half together, which just so happens to fall on Valentine’s Day<br>

		I want you to know that my love for you isn’t limited to this occasion. I love you every single day, always <i>"today more than yesterday."</i><br>

		You’ve given my life so much meaning and happiness, and I can’t imagine a day without you by my side.<br>

		Loving you is the easiest and most beautiful thing I’ve ever done.<br>

		No matter what life brings, I promise to stand by your side, to cherish you, and to love you unconditionally. You are my forever, my everything, and I’m so grateful to live this life with you, then, my wife for eternity in heaven Incha Allah...
	</p>

	<p>Every moment with you feels like a celebration of love, not because of the date but because you make every day special just by being you. I am thankful for you, Penny, always and forever.</p>
